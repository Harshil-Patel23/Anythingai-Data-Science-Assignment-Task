    "# Market Sentiment and Trader Performance Analysis\n",
    "## Exploring the Relationship Between Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index and Hyperliquid Trading Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis examines 52,497 trades from 32 traders on the Hyperliquid platform throughout 2024, analyzing their performance against Bitcoin's Fear & Greed Index. The findings reveal a **strong correlation between market sentiment and trading profitability**, with critical implications for risk management and trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaway:** Traders are significantly more profitable during bullish (greed) periods, while bearish (fear) periods result in net losses despite high win rates—a classic risk-reward inversion pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Scope\n",
    "- **Time Period:** January 1, 2024 - December 31, 2024\n",
    "- **Total Trades:** 52,497 trades across 341 active trading days\n",
    "- **Traders:** 32 unique accounts\n",
    "- **Coins Traded:** 246 different cryptocurrencies\n",
    "- **Sentiment Coverage:** 365 days of Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentiment Distribution (2024)\n",
    "- **Bullish (Greed + Extreme Greed):** 263 days (72.1%)\n",
    "- **Bearish (Fear + Extreme Fear):** 59 days (16.2%)\n",
    "- **Neutral:** 43 days (11.8%)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** 2024 was predominantly a bullish year, with greed sentiment dominating the market landscape.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 1: Sentiment Dramatically Impacts Profitability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Performance by Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentiment | Total Trades | Non-Zero PnL Trades | Win Rate | Total PnL | Avg PnL/Trade |\n",
    "|-----------|-------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|---------------|\n",
    "| **Bearish** | 1,451 | 475 | 73.1% | -$87,196 | -$183.57 |\n",
    "| **Neutral** | 1,293 | 559 | 55.1% | +$88,120 | +$157.64 |\n",
    "| **Bullish** | 49,747 | 26,066 | 84.6% | +$3,563,464 | +$136.71 |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Critical Insight:** Despite having a 73.1% win rate during bearish periods, traders still lose money on average. This represents a dangerous **risk-reward inversion** where small wins are obliterated by occasional catastrophic losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Profitability Analysis\n",
    "- **Bullish periods generate 98% of total profits** ($3.56M out of $3.56M net)\n",
    "- **Bearish periods result in net losses** despite winning 73% of trades\n",
    "- **Average loss per losing trade during fear is significantly larger** than average win per winning trade\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 2: The \"Catching Falling Knives\" Phenomenon\n",
    "\n",
    "During bearish (fear) periods, traders exhibit classic behavioral finance patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Paradox:**\n",
    "- ✓ High win rate (73.1%)\n",
    "- ✗ Negative returns (-$183.57 avg)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's happening:**\n",
    "- Traders successfully capture small rebounds (many small wins)\n",
    "- But fail to manage risk on major drawdowns (few massive losses)\n",
    "- Risk-reward ratio is inverted: winners average ~$50-100, losers can exceed $1,000+\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example Pattern:** A trader might win $50 on 7 out of 10 trades (+$350), but lose $500 on each of the 3 losing trades (-$1,500), resulting in a net loss of -$1,150 despite a 70% win rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 3: Trader Participation Varies Dramatically by Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trader Activity by Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentiment | Active Traders | Total Trades | Trades/Trader | % of Total Volume |\n",
    "|-----------|---------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|\n",
    "| **Bearish** | 7 traders | 1,451 | 207 | 2.8% |\n",
    "| **Neutral** | 9 traders | 1,293 | 144 | 2.5% |\n",
    "| **Bullish** | 31 traders | 49,747 | 1,605 | 94.7% |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trader Segmentation:**\n",
    "- **\"All-Weather\" Traders:** 6 traders active across all sentiment periods (19% of total)\n",
    "- **\"Fair-Weather\" Traders:** 21 traders ONLY active during bullish periods (68% of total)\n",
    "- **Sporadic Traders:** 5 traders with limited activity\n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavioral Insight:** The majority of traders (68%) deliberately avoid or significantly reduce activity during bearish periods, suggesting an awareness of the difficulty in profiting during fear-driven markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 4: Position Sizing and Trading Behavior Shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Average Position Size by Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentiment | Avg Position Size | Behavior |\n",
    "|-----------|------------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Bearish** | $4,574 | Medium-sized, cautious entries |\n",
    "| **Neutral** | $6,900 | **LARGEST positions** (highest conviction) |\n",
    "| **Bullish** | $3,324 | **SMALLEST positions** (risk management) |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counter-Intuitive Discovery:** Traders use their SMALLEST position sizes during the most profitable period (bullish), suggesting sophisticated risk management—taking many small profitable trades rather than large concentrated bets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Buy/Sell Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentiment | % BUY | % SELL | Interpretation |\n",
    "|-----------|-------|--------|----------------|\n",
    "| **Bearish** | 56.3% | 43.7% | Attempting to buy dips (contrarian) |\n",
    "| **Neutral** | 45.3% | 54.7% | Balanced approach |\n",
    "| **Bullish** | 44.0% | 56.0% | Taking profits, selling into strength |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy Observation:** Traders exhibit contrarian tendencies (buy fear, sell greed), but their execution during fear periods results in losses, suggesting poor timing or inadequate risk management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 5: Coin Selection Changes with Market Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Top 3 Coins Traded by Sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "| Sentiment | Top Coins | Characteristics |\n",
    "|-----------|-----------|-----------------|\n",
    "| **Bearish** | ETH, @4, @8 | Major coins + unknown tokens |\n",
    "| **Neutral** | ETH, BTC, @4 | Blue-chip cryptocurrencies |\n",
    "| **Bullish** | @107, HYPE, ETH | Meme coins and trending tokens |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "- During greed periods, traders shift toward **high-volatility meme coins** (HYPE, @107)\n",
    "- During fear periods, traders prefer **established major coins** (ETH, BTC)\n",
    "- **HYPE coin alone represents 32% of all trades**, concentrated during bullish periods\n",
    "\n",
    "**Profitability Note:** The shift to meme coins during bullish periods appears profitable, as these assets exhibit stronger momentum during greed phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding 6: The Zero-PnL Mystery\n",
    "\n",
    "**48.4% of all trades (25,391 trades) have zero PnL**, indicating:\n",
    "- Position openings that haven't been closed yet\n",
    "- The dataset captures both entry and exit transactions\n",
    "- Only 51.6% of trades represent completed positions with realized PnL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjusted Performance Metrics:**\n",
    "- When analyzing only closed positions (non-zero PnL), the true win/loss dynamics become clear\n",
    "- Win rates are significantly higher than initially apparent\n",
    "- But loss magnitude during bearish periods still dominates\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strategic Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Individual Traders\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid Active Trading During Extreme Fear**\n",
    "   - Historical data shows net losses despite high win rates\n",
    "   - Risk-reward is structurally unfavorable\n",
    "   - Better to wait for neutral/bullish conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement Strict Stop-Losses During Bearish Periods**\n",
    "   - The data shows small wins and large losses\n",
    "   - Position sizing must account for potential cascading losses\n",
    "   - Consider reducing leverage or position size by 50%+\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Capitalize on Bullish Momentum**\n",
    "   - 84.6% win rate and positive average PnL\n",
    "   - High-frequency trading with smaller positions works\n",
    "   - Meme coins and trending tokens outperform during this phase\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adopt Counter-Cyclical Position Sizing**\n",
    "   - Reduce position sizes during greed (protect gains)\n",
    "   - Increase caution during fear (manage tail risk)\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Risk Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sentiment-Based Portfolio Allocation**\n",
    "   - Reduce capital allocation during extended bearish periods\n",
    "   - Increase allocation during confirmed bullish trends\n",
    "   - Monitor sentiment transitions for rebalancing signals\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Volatility Adjustments**\n",
    "   - Expect higher loss volatility during fear periods\n",
    "   - Plan for drawdowns exceeding 2-3x normal during sentiment shifts\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sample Size Imbalance:** Bearish periods represent only 2.8% of total trades, which may limit statistical significance of bearish-period findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Survivorship Bias:** The dataset only includes traders who remained active through 2024. Traders who were eliminated or quit are not represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Temporal Causality:** While sentiment correlates with performance, we cannot definitively prove causation. Market conditions beyond sentiment (liquidity, volatility, news events) may be confounding factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Platform-Specific Behavior:** These patterns are specific to Hyperliquid traders and may not generalize to other platforms or trader populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **2024 Bias:** This was a predominantly bullish year (72% greed days). Results may differ in bear-market years with inverted sentiment distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Sentiment Lag:** The Fear & Greed Index is a lagging indicator. By the time \"extreme fear\" or \"extreme greed\" is registered, the optimal entry/exit point may have passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis reveals a **clear and actionable relationship between market sentiment and trading performance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bullish sentiment periods are highly profitable** (84.6% win rate, +$136 avg PnL)  \n",
    "**Most traders recognize this** and concentrate activity during greed  \n",
    "**Bearish sentiment periods are unprofitable** despite high win rates (risk-reward inversion)  \n",
    "**Trading during fear requires exceptional risk management** that most traders lack  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The Winning Strategy:** The data suggests that the most successful approach is not to trade counter-cyclically during fear, but rather to **reduce activity during bearish periods and capitalize aggressively during bullish trends**—contrary to the classic \"be fearful when others are greedy\" advice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 21 traders who only operate during bullish periods may actually be employing the most rational strategy based on historical profitability data.\n",
